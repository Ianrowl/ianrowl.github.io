          <h4>More about me.</h4>
          <p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado and was a student at Denver Waldorf School up until attending Littleton High School. My education has played a large role in the person I have become. In my early schooling, I was encouraged to be creative and imaginative with everything I did, and in high school, I was a part of the <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/">International Baccalaureate Program</a>,
          a rigorous program which taught me many technical skills as well as improved my preparation for college and work tremendously.

          <p>Some passions of mine include music and music production, creating visual art, and sports.</p><br>
