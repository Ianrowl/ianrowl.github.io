    <h1><em>Bernese Mountain Dog</em></h1>
    <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog (German: Berner Sennenhund) is a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">dog breed </a>, one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps. These dogs have roots in the Roman mastiffs. The name Sennenhund is derived from the German Senne ("alpine pasture") and Hund (hound/dog), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called Senn. Berner (or Bernese in English) refers to the area of the breed's origin, in the canton of Bern. This breed was originally kept as a general farm dog. Large Sennenhunde in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts. The breed was officially established in 1912</p>
